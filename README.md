### INTRODUCTION
In this work, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable, aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context. 

- We annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects, yielding 3.5K summary-citations pairs. 
  
- We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and consistency of generated content using four metrics. 
  
- We introduce a summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for comparison.
